# Hackathon -- Enterprise-AI

     · Enterprise Data Cleaning Pipeline

About Project -
the project is related to the how raw enterprise data can be cleaned and prepared for AI / analytics pipelines.
In real world, data is never clean. This pipeline shows how raw CSV files are processed step-by-step and converted into usable cleaned datasets.

Why this project -
While working with datasets, we noticed common problems like:
   · Missing values
   · Different column name formats
   · Mixed date formats
   · Inconsistent text values

These problems make it difficult to directly use data for ML or analysis.
This project focuses on fixing these issues.
